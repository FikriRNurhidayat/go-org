* go-org [[https://travis-ci.org/niklasfasching/go-org.svg?branch=master]]
A basic org-mode parser in go.
Take a look at [[https://niklasfasching.github.io/go-org/][github pages]] for some examples and an online org->html demo.
* next
- more keywords: https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-settings.html
- improve list parsing
  - handle list items with empty first line
  - handle checkboxes & statistic cookies
  - handle ordered list overrides [@10]
** TODO list checkboxes & statistics [0/2]
https://orgmode.org/manual/Checkboxes.html
1. [ ] parse checkbox of list item
   - convert to html radio button unchecked, indeterminate (visual only), checked
2. [ ] parse statistic cookies of headlines & first line of list items
   -convert to =[sub 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>] || [90%]=

* other differences to goorgeous
- no headline ids
- not changing links to .org files into links to .html files - this has edge cases like [[https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous/issues/56][mangling links to e.g. example.org]].
  could be supported for file: links though i guess
- org comments not rendered as html comments (same as ox-html.el)
- headline priority not exported to html (same as ox-html.el)
- goorgeous treats all `file:` links as images - go-org checks for an image file extension (same as ox-html.el)
- no support for [@10] in ordered lists https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous/issues/18
