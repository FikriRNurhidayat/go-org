* go-org [[https://travis-ci.org/niklasfasching/go-org.svg?branch=master]]
A basic Org mode parser in go.
Take a look at [[https://niklasfasching.github.io/go-org/][github pages]] for some examples and an online org -> html demo (requires wasm support).
* next
- test against [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/master/test/site/content-org/all-posts.org][ox-hugo all-posts.org]]
  - ATTR_HTML without printing child - i.e. above other, non-affiliated keyword
  - blocks with indent < their parent
    #+BEGIN_SRC
> this
    #+END_SRC
- more keywords: https://orgmode.org/manual/In_002dbuffer-settings.html
- headlines
  - unique ids
    - CUSTOM_ID drawer property
    - see [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/blob/8472cf2d8667754c9da3728255634e8001a1da6d/ox-hugo.el#L1785-L1850][ox-hugo]] for auto generation
- improve list parsing
  - handle list items with empty first line
  - handle ordered list overrides [@10]
* differences to goorgeous
To get a feeling take a look at goorgeous vs go-org html rendering of the examples [[https://niklasfasching.github.io/go-org/go-org-vs-goorgeous][comparison]].
Please note that a visual comparison is not fair to goorgeous as the stylesheet is not adapted to it.
Nonetheless, the html output can be compared by taking a look in the developer console where relevant.

- no headline ids
- not changing links to .org files into links to .html files
  - do not plan to implement this, too many edge cases (e.g. [[https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous/issues/56][mangling links to e.g. example.org]].)
- org comments not rendered as html comments (same as ox-html.el)
- headline priority not exported to html (same as ox-html.el)
- goorgeous treats all `file:` links as images - go-org checks for an image file extension (same as ox-html.el)
- no support for [@10] in ordered lists https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous/issues/18
  - do not plan to implement this
