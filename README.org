A basic org-mode parser in go
* motivation
- have a org-mode AST to play around with building an org-mode language server
- hopefully add reasonable org-mode support to hugo - sadly [[https://github.com/chaseadamsio/goorgeous][goorgeous]] is broken & abandoned
* next
- hugo frontmatter - see https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/
- captions: images, tables & blocks
* later
- affiliated keywords
  see org-element.el - org-element-affiliated-keywords
- keywords: support both multi (e.g. LINK, TODO) & normal (e.g. AUTHOR, TITLE) keywords
- links based on #+LINK
- includes https://orgmode.org/manual/Include-files.html
  could be used to have a single org file (ignored via hugo ignoreFiles) and then for each post a file including the relevant headline
- tables
  colgroups https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/tables.html
- org-entities replacement: see org-entities-help
