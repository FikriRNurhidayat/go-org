#+TITLE: Example org mode file
#+AUTHOR: Niklas Fasching
#+DESCRIPTION: just some random elements with little explanation

* Motivation

To validate the parser we'll try printing the AST back to org-mode source - if that
works we can be kind of sure that the parsing worked.
At least I hope so - I would like to get around writing tests for the individual parsing
functions...

** Headlines with TODO status, priority & tags
*** TODO [#B] Headline with todo status & priority
*** DONE Headline with TODO status
*** [#A] Headline with tags & priority                              :foo:bar:
this one is cheating a little as tags are ALWAYS printed right aligned to a given column number...
** Lists
- unordered list item 1
- unordered list item 2 - with ~inline~ /markup/
  1. ordered sublist item 1
     a) ordered sublist item 1
     b) ordered sublist item 2
     c) ordered sublist item 3
  2. ordered sublist item 2
- unordered list item 3 - and a [[https://example.com][link]]
  and some lines of text
  1. and another subitem
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     echo with a block
     #+END_SRC
  2. and another one with a table
     | a | b | c |
     |---+---+---|
     | 1 | 2 | 3 |

     and text with an empty line in between as well!
- unordered list item 4

** Inline
- /emphasis/ and a hard line break \\
  see?
- /.emphasis with dot border chars./
- /emphasis with a slash/inside/
- /emphasis/ followed by raw text with slash /
- ->/not an emphasis/<-
- links with slashes do not become /emphasis/: [[https://somelinkshouldntrenderaccidentalemphasis.com]]/ /emphasis/
- _underlined_ *bold*  =verbatim= ~code~ +strikethrough+
- *bold string with an *asterisk inside*
- links
  1. regular link [[https://example.com]] link without description
  2. regular link [[https://example.com][example.com]] link with description
  3. regular link to a file (image) [[file:my-img.png]]
** Footnotes
- normal footnote reference [fn:1]
- further references to the same footnote should not [fn:1] render duplicates in the footnote list
- also inline footnotes are supported via =fn:2:inline definition=. But we won't test that because it would
  cause the output to look different from the input

* Footnotes
[fn:1] Foobar
