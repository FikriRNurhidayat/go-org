#+OPTIONS:

* DONE [#A] =#+OPTIONS:= toggles supported by =go-org=            :tag1:tag2:
=go-org= supports multiple export toggles as described in the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html][export settings]] Org mode manual.
By default those toggles are enabled. This files starts with =#+OPTIONS:= (empty options) and thus
disables all settings.
That means, entities like =---= --- (mdash) will be left untouched, footnotes like =[fn:1]= [fn:1] will
not be exported and there won't be a table of contents at the top.
Also, the above headline will be exported without priority, todo status & tags.
