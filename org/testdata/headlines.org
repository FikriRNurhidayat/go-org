* CUSTOM headline with custom status
it's possible to use =#+SETUPFILE= - in this case the setup file contains the following

#+INCLUDE: "setup_file_org" src org
* excluded headline                                                :custom_noexport:
this headline and it's content are not exported as it is marked with an =EXCLUDE_TAGS= tag.
By default =EXCLUDE_TAGS= is just =:noexport:=.
